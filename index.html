    <p>HyperText Markup Language é o significado de HTML.</p> 
    <p>You don't "run" HTML, that's why you can't call it a programming language. It's like an 
        essay. Your essay doesn't run anything. </p> 
    <p>There are opening tags and closing tags. The one with <> is the opening and the one
    with </> is the closing tag.</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph. Here you put the content you want to be showed.</p>
    <h1>Title tags</h1>
    <p>There is a hierarchy between the tags. The h1 is bigger than h2, the h2 is bigger than
        than the h3... </p>
        <h1>This is a h1</h1>
        <h2>This is a h2</h2>
        <h3>This is a h3</h3>
        <h4>This is a h4</h4>
        <h5>This is a h5</h5>
        <h6>This is a h6 - the last one</h6>
    <p>The most used are h1 and h2.</p>
    <p>There are anchors, that are used for providing links.</p>
    <a href="">This is a link that doesn't have a destiny.</a>
