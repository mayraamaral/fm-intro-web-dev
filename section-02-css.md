# CSS
CSS means Cascadian Style Sheets.  
You can make rules about the way you want things to be displayed on the page.  
Here's the configuration:  
If we want every h1 in the page to be red, so we have to do this:
h1 { the condition }  
We call the h1 the selector, and everything that will be inside the {} will be rules that your page will folow.  
Following our example,  
h1 { color: red; }  
color is called the **property**, because is something that will be applied.
