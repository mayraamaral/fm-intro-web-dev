## Tags
Tags are components thats make possible to select which part of the you are and use many funcionalities.  
As example we have the **head**, **body**, the title tags (**h1** and the following tags), and a lot of 
another tags that gives us the power to structure our code.  
We have tags with some content inside and for this we need the opening tags and the closing tags. As example: < h1 >Hi</ h1 >. *Note: The spaces between the greater and lesser than are just for formatting, if it do not happens the archive will read it as a title*.  
But we also have tags that does not have (or need) any kind of content for existing and for this we call self closing tags.
