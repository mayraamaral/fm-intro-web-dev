## Tags
Tags are components thats make possible to select which part of the document you are and use many funcionalities.  
As example we have the **head**, **body**, the title tags (**h1** and the following tags), and a lot of 
another tags that gives us the power to structure our code.  
### Opening, closing tags and content
We have tags with some content inside and for this we need the opening tags and the closing tags.  
As example: < h1 >Hi</ h1 >. *Note: The spaces between the greater and lesser than are just for formatting, if it do not happens the archive will read it as a title*. We call content what will be in the users screen.  
### Self closing tags (or void tags)
But we also have tags that does not have (or need) any kind of content for existing (that's why it is also called void tags) and for this we call self closing tags.  
As example: < meta charset="utf-8">. This tag does not needs any content for existing, it's just signaling to the browser which kind of charset we will use in our website.

  
*Disclaimer: things can look different across the browsers, but you can make it look the same through CSS*
